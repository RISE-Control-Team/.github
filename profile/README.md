## Introduction
This repository is part of the control team of [RISE](https://www.riseteam.nl/).  

The folders contain the overall R&D of the control team which contributes to the success of [Project Alpha](https://www.riseteam.nl/alpha).  

The Control Teams’s primary role entails designing the control systems of the Aplha rocket. The team's responsability is the development of the control algorithms to regulate the launch, ascent, descent and landing phase of Alpha. Currently, the rocket includes Thrust Vector Control (TVC), Air Braking System (ABS), Support Ascent Mechanism (SAM) and Support Descent Mechanism (SDM) as its mechanisms for the overall control of the rocket.

By leveraging the expertise in control theory and engineering, the Control Team contributes to RISE's objective of advancing rocket technology and achieving a rocket landing using retro propulsion.
